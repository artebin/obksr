Openbox http://openbox.org/ is a wonderful window manager that can be easily integrated and used combined with the GNOME or the KDE desktops. It is a highly configurable window manager.
This short project include a java code for parsing the openbox main configuration file (~/.config/openbox/rc.xml) extract the keyboard shortcuts and produces a file that contains a textual flavour of these shortcuts.
By the next, run the shell script obksr.sh that use libnotify-bin (actually the notify-send command) to show a notification that contains the keyboard shortcuts from the openbox configuration file. You can also add a keyboard shortcut for running this script!
